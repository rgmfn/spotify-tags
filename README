Inside this folder run `npm install` (npm = node package manager, node = javascript's runtime environment) to install the correct javascript libraries.

In the frontend folder, run `npm start` to start up the node server. It should open in a browser, otherwise go to `localhost:3000` in a browser to access the app. The page should update as your code changes.
