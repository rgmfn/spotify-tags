Installation Guide
------------------

After cloning the repo, in the project root, run `npm install`. This will call `npm install` inside the frontend/ and backend/ folders, installing all of the packages needed.

Go into the backend/ folder and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the database. Later you will run `docker-compose down` to stop running the database.

Before you run the program, make sure the database is running. Then, run `npm start` in the project root. This will call npm start inside the frontend/ and backend/ folders, starting the frontend and backend.

Go to `localhost:3000` in a browser to begin using.
