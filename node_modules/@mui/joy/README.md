Joy UI is a library of beautifully designed React UI components.

It features foundational components such as the ones you'd find in Material UI and it comes with a beautifully designed default theme so you can rapidly start your own design system. You should see Joy UI as a starting point. It comes with a lot of customization features so you match it to your desired look and feel.

> **Warning**
> As of today, Joy UI is in active development, with an alpha version soon to be released.
> We're adding new components and features regularly, and you're welcome to contribute!
> Look for the `package: joy` label on open issues and pull requests in the mui/material-ui repository on GitHub to see what other community members are working on, and feel free to submit your own.
